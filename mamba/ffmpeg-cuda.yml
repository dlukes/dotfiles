# An attempt at setting up an environment in which ffmpeg with hardware acceleration can
# be compiled. Got stuck at one of the conda-provided libs expecting the wrong version
# of glibc, I think. So this is very much WIP. Maybe the most hassle-free way to get
# this working on Solus is via nvidia-docker, which will have all the correct deps.
